# JobInterview-Public

First task for Belgrade Institute of Technology javaScript bootcamp certification.

A responsive public web application, which can be used by anyone, and which is responsible for read-only overview of Candidates and Interview Reports.

The app consists of a List of Candidates Page (also the landing page) and a Candidate Reports Page.

The List of Candidates Page is written in vanilla javaScript (ES5). It uses a card layout with candidate Name, Avatar and Email shown and enables candidate filtering by name.

The Candidate Reports Page is written using jQuery. This page displays detailed information about a single candidate, including a list of interview reports. When a single report is selected, additional details are shown in a modal dialog.
